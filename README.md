# 🧠 Named Entity Recognition (NER) with Transformers

This implementation of **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using modern **Transformer-based architectures** like BERT! This project demonstrates how to extract entities such as names, organizations, locations, and more from natural language text using deep learning. 📊📚

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🤖 Built using **HuggingFace Transformers**
- 🏷️ Supports custom tagging schemes (BIO, BILOU)
- 🔬 Fine-tuned for **NER tasks** with token-level classification
- 📈 Visualization of predictions on sample inputs
- 📁 Modular and reusable Jupyter Notebook

## 🧩 What is NER?

**Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is a subtask of Information Extraction that classifies named entities into predefined categories such as:

- 📍 **Location** (e.g., "Paris", "India")
- 👤 **Person** (e.g., "Albert Einstein")
- 🏢 **Organization** (e.g., "Google", "UN")
- 🗓️ **Date/Time** (e.g., "March 26th", "2025")
